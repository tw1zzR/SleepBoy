# SleepBoy ‚Äî Discord Sleep Timer & TTS Bot

**SleepBoy** is a fun Discord bot designed for entertainment purposes only.
It can speak via TTS in Ukrainian, set a sleep timer (after which it kicks everyone from the voice channel over two minutes), and correctly pronounce hours, minutes, and seconds with proper Ukrainian grammatical endings.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository or copy the project files.**


2.  **Create a `.env` file in the root project folder with the following content:**

    ```env
    BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Discord bot token.


3.  **Create a `phrases.py` file in the root folder** with three lists:

    ```python
    greetings = ["Hello everyone", "Hey there", "Hi friends", ...]
    farewells = ["Goodbye", "See you later", "Take care", ...]
    appeals = ["friend", "buddy", "pal", ...]
    ```

    These lists contain phrases the bot will randomly speak via TTS for greetings, farewells, and appeals.

    **Important:**
    The `phrases.py` file and the `temp` folder (which stores temporary TTS audio files) are included in `.gitignore` by default, so they won‚Äôt be uploaded to GitHub.
    You must create `phrases.py` manually or replace all uses of these lists in the code with your own strings and remove unused imports if needed.


4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Or at least:
    ```bash
    pip install discord.py python-dotenv gTTS
    ```

5.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

## Additional Configuration

- In the `on_voice_state_update` function, set your own channel ID in this line:

  ```python
  channel = bot.get_channel(YOUR_CHANNEL_ID)
  ```
  
  This is the text channel where the bot will send the message::
  ```python
  await channel.send(f"üñï <@{member.id}> –∞–ª–æ –≤–∞—Å—è, –π–¥–∏ —Å–ø–∞—Ç—å")
  ```
  
  - üí¨ **Tip:** Use a channel like #spam or another one specifically for bot messages to avoid cluttering important chats.


- You can also change the language or content of any spoken or printed message at any point in the code by simply replacing the existing text with your own in any language.

## Project Structure
```bash

 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Your BOT_TOKEN (ignored by git)
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phrases.py            # Your greeting/farewell/appeal lists (ignored by git)
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ temp/                 # Temporary TTS audio files (auto-cleaned, ignored by git)

## How It Works

The sleep timer runs for the specified minutes, then kicks all users from the voice channel over 2 minutes.

The bot announces remaining time and messages with proper Ukrainian declensions.

Temporary audio files for TTS are saved in the `temp/` folder and cleaned up automatically every 16 minutes.

Commands `/join`, `/leave`, `/sleeptime`, `/notify`, `/speak`, and `/stop` control the bot's behavior.

## Customizing Phrases

You can edit the `phrases.py` file to add your own greeting, farewell, and appeal phrases. Alternatively, replace all usages of `random.choice(greetings/farewells/appeals)` in the code with your own static strings and remove the phrases import if you don‚Äôt want to use the external file.
